# Green Button Initiative - Weather-Based Energy Optimization
# Overview
The Green Button Initiative is an industry-led effort launched in response to a 2012 White House call-to-action. It enables electricity, natural gas, and water customers to easily and securely access their energy usage data in both consumer-friendly and computer-readable formats. This initiative empowers consumers to make informed decisions about their energy consumption, promoting efficiency and cost savings.

# Project Summary
This project integrates Green Button energy usage data with real-time weather forecasting to provide actionable insights for optimizing energy consumption. By analyzing historical energy usage patterns and combining them with weather predictions, the system can:

- Identify peak energy consumption periods.
- Suggest ways to reduce electricity usage based on weather conditions.
- Improve energy efficiency by leveraging weather insights.
