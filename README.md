# Green Button Initiative - Weather-Based Utility Optimization
# Overview
The Green Button Initiative is a standardized effort that allows consumers to securely access their energy and water usage data from utility providers. This initiative was launched to promote data-driven energy efficiency and help individuals and businesses make informed decisions about their electricity and water consumption.

This project was developed as part of my capstone project, where my group and I integrated machine learning models to predict electricity usage, electricity costs, and water consumption based on historical trends and real-time weather data. By analyzing past utility usage alongside temperature and precipitation forecasts, this system provides valuable insights that can help users optimize their energy consumption, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between energy data and predictive analytics, making it easier for consumers to make data-driven decisions about their utility usage. This system is designed to work with Green Button data in both XML and CSV formats, ensuring compatibility with different utility data sources.

# Project Features
This project integrates historical energy and water consumption data with real-time weather forecasts to provide actionable insights for optimizing electricity usage, water consumption, and cost estimation. By leveraging machine learning models, users can better understand how environmental factors impact their utility usage and make informed decisions to improve efficiency.

 Key features include:

- Water Usage Prediction → Uses historical Green Button water consumption data and weather forecasts to predict daily water usage.
- Electricity Usage Forecasting → Analyzes past energy consumption trends and predicts future electricity usage based on temperature and precipitation data.
- Electricity Cost Estimation → Utilizes Lasso Regression to estimate future electricity costs based on past trends and peak-hour pricing.
- Machine Learning Models → Implements Random Forest, Decision Trees, Lasso Regression, and Linear Regression for data-driven forecasting.
- Green Button Data Compatibility → Supports both XML and CSV formats, making it adaptable for different data sources.

# Project Summary
This project integrates Green Button energy usage data with real-time weather forecasting to provide actionable insights for optimizing energy consumption. By analyzing historical energy usage patterns and combining them with weather predictions, the system can:

- Identify peak energy consumption periods.
- Suggest ways to reduce electricity usage based on weather conditions.
- Improve energy efficiency by leveraging weather insights.
